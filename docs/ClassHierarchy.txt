Overlap
  All but Spell have name, description, and picture. Spell does not have the picture. A posible idea would be to have a super class 
  called something like RPGToolbox.java which they all extend that has a name, description, and picture. The spells would have the 
  extra variable but it could be left blank.
  Monster and Character are also almost the same with each having a few things that the other does not. There could be a shared super
  class for these two.
  There are potential structures for these two super classes at the end.
